## Overview

FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a specially-designed language for defining the content of FHIR Implementation Guides (IG). It is simple and compact, with tools to produce [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/overview.html) profiles, extensions and implementation guides (IG). Because it is a _language_, written in text statements, FSH encourages distributed, team-based development using conventional source code control tools such as GitHub. FSH provides tooling that enables you to define a model once, and publish that model to multiple versions of FHIR.

SUSHI (aka "SUSHI Unshortens Short Hand Inputs") is the proposed name for the command-line interpreter/compiler for FSH.

## Contents of the Repository

This repository contains the source files to generate the FHIR Shorthand Implementation Guide. At this point in time, the IG consists of documentation only. The markdown source files for the documentation are found here: https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shorthand/tree/master/input/pagecontent. The built documentation is currently located at: http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/. 

The wiki that is part of this repo (https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shorthand/wiki) contains design proposals and discussions from the early days of FHIR Shorthand and is NOT kept up to date. If you are looking for up-to-date FHIR Shorthand documentation, go to http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/.

We intend to use the repository for training materials, demos, and other artifacts, such as the examples in the GettingStarted directory.

## Building the IG

Changes to the master branch are automatically propagated to build.fhir.org. 

A local build of the FSH IG can be generated by running `_genonce` at the command line.
