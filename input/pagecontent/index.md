* [FHIR Shorthand Tutorial](tutorial) -- A step-by-step hands-on introduction to producing an IG with FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI.
* [FHIR Shorthand Language Reference](reference) -- The syntax and usage of the FHIR Shorthand language.
* [SUSHI User Guide](sushi) -- A guide to producing an IG from FSH files using SUSHI compiler and the HL7 IG Publishing tool.

#### FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI
FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining the contents of FHIR Implementation Guides (IG). The language is specifically designed for this purpose, simple and compact, and allows the author to express their intent with fewer concerns about underlying FHIR mechanics. FSH can be created and updated using any text editor, and because it is text, it enables distributed, team-based development using source code control tools such as Github.

Accompanying the FSH language is a reference implementation, [SUSHI](sushi), that translates FSH into FHIR artifacts and enables production of FHIR IGs. There is also a tool, [FSH Food](https://github.com/lantanagroup/fshfood), that converts profiles and extensions (StructureDefinitions) into FSH. Together with the [HL7 IG Publisher](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation), these tools present a complete solution for creating and maintaining a FHIR IG.

#### Motivations for FHIR Shorthand

FHIR Shorthand was created in response to the need in the FHIR community for scalable, fast, user-friendly tools for IG creation and maintenance. Experience has shown that profiling projects can be difficult and slow, and the resulting IG quality can be inconsistent. Profiling projects often go through many iterations, and as such, an agile approach to refactoring and revision is invaluable.

There are already several existing methods for IG creation: hand editing, using [Excel spreadsheets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Spreadsheet+Profile+Authoring), [Simplifier/Forge](https://fire.ly/products/simplifier-net/), and [Trifolia-on-FHIR](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com). Each of these methods have certain advantages as well as drawbacks:

1. Hand-editing StructureDefinitions (SDs) is unwieldy, but authors get full control over every aspect of the resulting profiles and extensions.
1. The spreadsheet method has existed since before FHIR 1.0 and has been used to produce sophisticated IGs such as [US Core](https://github.com/HL7/US-Core-R4). A significant downside is that version management is next to impossible; either the files are saved in binary form (.xslx) or as XML files, with the content lost in thousands of lines of formatting.
1. Simplifier/Forge and Trifolia-on-FHIR provide graphical user interfaces that are very helpful guiding users through common tasks. However, making significant cross-cutting changes ([refactoring](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/code-refactoring)) requires navigating through many screens. Currently these tools are not advanced in terms of source code control (SCC) features.

Experience across many domains has shown that complex software projects are best approached with textual languages. As a DSL designed for the job of profiling and IG creation, FSH is concise, understandable, and aligned to user intentions. Users may find that the FSH language representation is the best way to understand a set of profiles. Because it is text-based, FHIR Shorthand brings a degree of editing agility not found in graphical tools (cutting and pasting, global search and replace, spell checking, etc.) FSH is ideal for distributed development under source code control, providing meaningful version-to-version differentials, support for merging and conflict resolution, and nimble refactoring. These features allow FSH to scale in ways that other approaches cannot. Any text editor can be used to create or modify FSH.

### Creating an IG with FSH and SUSHI

As illustrated below, creating an IG with FSH and SUSHI consists of three steps:

1. Populating a FSH Tank (a directory) with FSH files containing definitions of FHIR artifacts, and additional content for your IG.
2. Compiling those files using the SUSHI compiler
3. Creating the IG using the HL7 FHIR IG Publishing Tool

![Overall FSH Workflow](../images/Workflow.png "Overall SUSHI Workflow")

#### FSH Tanks

A **FSH Tank** refers to a directory that contains FSH files for an IG. A FSH Tank corresponds one-to-one to an IG and represents a complete module that can be placed under SCC. The FHIR artifacts (profiles, extensions, value sets, examples, etc.) are defined by FSH files in the FSH Tank. Any other FHIR artifacts (such as profiles from another IG) are "external" and must be declared in dependencies.

Information is stored in plain text files with `.fsh` extension. Each file can contain multiple items. It is up to the author to decide how to divide information between the between FSH files. Here are some possibilities:

* Divide up according to the type of item: profiles in one file, value sets in another, extensions in another, etc.
* Group things logically, for example, a profile together with its value sets, extensions, and examples.
* Use one file for each item (and potentially put similar items in different subdirectories).

Additional IG content such as narrative page content, images, and customized menus are also part of the FSH Tank (the rice and seaweed in the illustration). This is discussed in the [SUSHI Users Guide](sushi#ig-creation).

#### Running SUSHI

SUSHI is a translator that converts FSH to FHIR. Currently, SUSHI is installed and runs locally on your own computer from the command line. Installing SUSHI is described [here](sushi#installation). The language (Typescript) and the underlying architecture of SUSHI is compatible with future server-based deployment.

After SUSHI runs, a new directory appears in the FSH Tank. This directory (named _/build_ by default) contains all the files necessary to run the IG Publisher. FHIR artifacts, such as profiles, extensions, value sets, and instances can be found in the _/build/input_ directory after running SUSHI.

#### Running the IG Publisher

After running SUSHI, the IG Publisher can be run from the build directory, populating the _/build/output_ directory. The home page for the IG is _/build/output/index.html_. It can be opened in any browser.

If HL7 is publishing your IG, you need to move the build files (excluding _/build/output_, _/build/temp_, and _/build/template_) to your IG's repository on http://hl7.github.com. When you copy the build files to the HL7 repository, the IG Publisher will run automatically, and your IG will appear on the continuous integration site, https://build.fhir.org.

### Shorthand Language Overview

The complete grammar of FSH is described in the [FHIR Shorthand Language Reference](reference). Here we present just enough to get a taste of FSH.

#### Basics

* **Formal grammar**: [FSH has a formal grammar](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/tree/master/antlr/src/main/antlr) defined in [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/).
* **Reserved words**: FSH has a number of special words that are considered part of the language, and cannot be used as item names. Refer to the keywords section in [FSH's formal ANTLR4 grammar](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/tree/master/antlr/src/main/antlr) for a complete list of these words.
* **Data types**: The primitive and complex data types and value formats in FSH are identical to the [primitive types and value formats in FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#primitive).
* **Whitespace**: Repeated whitespace is not meaningful within FSH files.
* **Comments**: FSH follows [JavaScript syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comments.asp) for code comments, with `//` denoting single-line comments, and the pair `/*`  `*/` delimiting multiple line comments.
* **Asterisk Character**: A leading asterisk is used to denote FSH rules. For example, here is a rule to set `Organization.active` to `true`:

  `* active = true`

* **Escape Character**: FSH uses the backslash as the escape character in string literals. For example, use `\"` to embed a quotation mark in a string.
* **Circumflex Character ("Caret Syntax")**: FSH uses the circumflex (also called caret) `^` to directly reference the definitional structure associated with an item. For example, when defining a profile, caret syntax allows you to refer to elements in the StructureDefinition. For example, to set the element `StructureDefinition.experimental`:

  `* ^experimental = false`

* **Aliases**: To improve readability, FSH allows the user to define aliases for URLs and oids. Once defined anywhere in the FSH tank, the alias can be used anywhere the url or oid can be used. For example:

  `Alias: SCT = http://snomed.info/sct`



#### Coded Data Types

FSH provides special grammar for expressing coded data types. The shorthand for a Coding is:

`{system}#{code} "{display text}"`

For a FHIR `code` data type, the {system} is omitted. The display text is optional but helps with readability. The `{system}` represents the controlled terminology that the code is taken from. Here are a few examples:

* The code 363346000 from SNOMED-CT:

  `http://snomed.info/sct#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

* The same code, using the Snomed-CT alias defined above: 

  `SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

This grammar can be used when assigning a coded value to an element whose data type is code, Coding, or CodeableConcept. FSH uses the `=` sign to express assignment. Assignment statements (and other [FSH rules](#rules)) always begin with an asterisk.

* To set the first Coding in a CodeableConcept:

  `* bodySite = SCT#87878005 "Left cardiac ventricular structure"`

* To set the text of a CodeableConcept:

  `* bodySite.text = "Left ventricle"`

Quantity is another case of a coded data type. The code is interpreted as the units of measure of the quantity:

 ```
 Alias: UCUM = http://unitsofmeasure.org
 ...
 * valueQuantity = UCUM#mm "millimeters"
 ```

#### Keywords

Keywords are used to make declarations that introduce new items. A keyword statement follows the syntax:

`{Keyword}: {value or expression}`

Here's an example of keywords declaring a profile:

```
Profile:  CancerDiseaseStatus
Parent:   Observation
Id:       mcode-cancer-disease-status
Title:    "Cancer Disease Status"
Description: "A clinician's qualitative judgment on the current trend of the cancer, e.g., whether it is stable, worsening (progressing), or improving (responding)."
```

Keywords that declare new items (the `Profile` keyword in the previous example) must occur first in any set of keywords. There are nine primary keywords in FSH:

* Alias
* CodeSystem
* Extension
* Instance
* Invariant
* Mapping
* Mixin
* Profile
* ValueSet

Note that not every type of FSH item has a direct FHIR equivalent. Alias and Mixin are strictly FSH constructs, while Mappings and Invariants appear only as elements within a StructureDefinition.

Keywords common to many types of items include:

* Description
* Id
* Title

Specialized keywords, used only with one type of item include:

* InstanceOf (Instance)
* Usage (Instance)
* Parent (Profile)
* Mixins (Profile)
* Source (Mapping)
* Target (Mapping)
* Severity (Invariant)
* XPath (Invariant)
* Expression (Invariant)

Each type of item has a different set of required and optional keywords. For example, to define a profile, the keywords `Profile` and `Parent` are required, and `Id`, `Title`, and `Description` are recommended. The keyword `Mixins` is optional. The [FSH Language Reference](reference) contains a [complete list of keywords and their usage](reference#keywords).

#### Rules

The keyword section is followed by a number of rules. Rules are the mechanism for constraining a profile, defining an extension, creating slices, and more. All rules begin with an asterisk:

`* {rule statement}`

There are nine types of rules in FSH. The [formal syntax of rules](reference#rules) are given in the [FSH Language reference](reference). Here is a quick summary:

* Fixed value or assignment rules are used to set constant values in profiles and instances. For example:

  `* bodySite.text = "Left ventricle"`

  `* onsetDateTime = "2019-04-02"`

  `* status = #arrived`

* Value set binding rules are used with elements with coded values to specify the set of enumerated values for that element. Binding rules include one of FHIR's binding strengths (example, preferred, extensible, or required). For example:

  `* gender from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender (required)`

  `* address.state from USPSTwoLetterAlphabeticCodes (extensible)`

* Cardinality rules constrain the number of occurrences of an element, either both upper and lower bounds, or just upper or lower bound. For example:

  `* note 0..0`

  `* note 1..`

  `* note ..5`

* Data type rules restrict the type of value that can be used in an element. For example:

  `* value[x] only CodeableConcept`

  `* onset[x] only Period or Range`

* Reference type rules restrict the type of resource that a Reference can refer to. For example:

  `* recorder only Reference(Practitioner)`

  `* recorder only Reference(Practitioner | PractitionerRole)`

* Flag assignment rules add bits of information about elements impacting how implementers should handle them. For example:

  `* communication MS ?!`

  `* identifier, identifier.system, identifier.value, name, name.family MS`

* Extension rules specify elements populating extensions arrays. Extensions can either be defined inline or standalone. Inline extensions do not create a StructureDefinition. Stand-alone extensions are those with independent StructureDefinitions, and include extensions defined by other IGs or extensions defined in the same FSH tank, using the `Extension` keyword. 

Here are two examples of defining inline extensions:

 ```
   * bodySite.extension contains laterality 0..1
```

```
   * extension contains
       treatmentIntent 0..1 MS and
       terminationReason 0..* MS
```

Typically, after defining an inline extension, 

   // now constrain the value of the inline extension
   * bodySite.extension[laterality].value[x] only CodeableConcept
   * bodySite.extension[laterality].valueCodeableConcept from LateralityVS (required)


   // now constrain the values of the extension
   * extension[treatmentIntent].value[x] only CodeableConcept
   * extension[treatmentIntent].valueCodeableConcept from TreatmentIntentVS (required)
   * extension[terminationReason].value[x] only CodeableConcept
   * extension[terminationReason].valueCodeableConcept from TreatmentTerminationReasonVS (required)


Here is a similar example using standalone extensions. The main difference is that the external reference must be assigned a local name (`named {x}`):

```
  // Aliases for convenience
  Alias: USCoreRace = http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race
  Alias: USCoreEthnicity = http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-ethnicity
  Alias: USCoreBirthsex = http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex

  // include the external extensions with a local name
  * extension contains
      USCoreRace named race 0..1 MS and
      USCoreEthnicity named ethnicity 0..1 MS and
      USCoreBirthsex named birthsex 0..1 MS
```

* Slicing rules specify the types of elements an array element can contain.

```
  * component contains
      SystolicBP 1..1 and
      DiastolicBP 1..1
```

* Invariant rules associate elements with XPath or FHIRPath constraints they must obey.
