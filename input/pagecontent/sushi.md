SUSHI ("SUSHI Unshortens ShortHand Inputs") is a reference implementation of an interpreter/compiler for the FHIR Shorthand ("FSH" or "Shorthand") language. SUSHI produces [Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) profiles, extensions, and other artifacts needed to create FHIR Implementation Guides (IG).

This reference manual is a comprehensive guide to the command line interface, auxiliary files, and configurations needed to create an HL7 FHIR IG using SUSHI. It is targeted to people doing IG development using FSH. Familiarity with FHIR is helpful as the manual references various FHIR concepts (profiles, extensions, value sets, etc.)

This guide assumes you have:

* Reviewed the [FHIR Shorthand Tutorial](tutorial.html)
* Created FSH files representing your profiles and other IG artifacts (see [Authoring Guide](index.html) and [FSH Language Reference](reference.html) for details).

The following conventions are used:

| Style | Explanation | Example |
|:----------|:------|:---------|
| `Code` | Code fragments, such as commands, FSH statements, and syntax expressions  | `* status = #open` |
| {curly braces} | An item to be substituted in a syntax pattern | `{codesystem}#{code}` |
| **bold** | A directory path or file name | **example-1.fsh** |
{: .grid }


| Symbol | Explanation |
|:----------|:------|
| 🍎 | Indicates information or command specific to OS X. The instructions assume the shell script is **bash**. As of the Mac Catalina release, the default is **zsh** and will need to be reconfigured as a default or at runtime to call bash shell. You can find out the default shell in a Mac terminal by running `echo $SHELL`.|
| 💻 | Indicates information or command specific to Windows. A command window can be launched by typing `cmd` at the _Search Windows_ tool. |
| $ | Represents command prompt (may vary depending on platform) |

### Installation

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
SUSHI requires Node.js. To install Node.js, go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and you should see links to download an installer for your operating system. Download the installer for the LTS version. If you do not see a download appropriate for your operating system, click the "other downloads" link and look there. Once the installer is downloaded, run the installer. It is fine to select default options during installation.

Ensure that Node.js is correctly installed by opening a command window and typing the following two commands. Each command should return a version number.

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

#### Step 2: Install SUSHI

To install SUSHI, open up a command prompt.

```
$ npm install -g fsh-sushi
```

Check the installation by typing the following command:

```
$ sushi -h
```

If the command outputs instructions on using SUSHI command line interface (CLI), you're ready to run SUSHI.

Use `$ sushi -v` to display version of SUSHI

SUSHI follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) convention (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

* MAJOR: A major release has significant new functionality and potentially, grammar changes or other non-backward-compatible changes.
* MINOR: Contains new or modified features, while maintaining backwards compatibility within the major version.
* PATCH: Contains minor updates and bug fixes, while maintaining backwards compatibility within the major version.

For the most up-to-date information and latest releases of SUSHI, check the [release history and release notes](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/releases).

##### Updating or Reverting SUSHI

To update SUSHI to the latest version, re-run:

```
$ npm install -g fsh-sushi
```

To revert to a previous version of SUSHI, run:

```
npm install -g fsh-sushi@{version}
```

where the version is in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.


### Executing SUSHI

SUSHI is executed from the command line. The general form of the SUSHI execution command is as follows:

```
$ sushi {specification-directory} {options}
```

where options include:

```
-o, --out <out>   the path to the output directory (default: /build)
-h, --help        output usage information
-v, --version     output the version of SUSHI
-s, --snapshot    have SUSHI generate profile snapshots
```

The options are not order-sensitive.

> Note: By default, SUSHI only generates the [profile differential](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#snapshot), leaving it to the IG Publisher to create the [profile snapshot](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#snapshot). The `-s` option will cause SUSHI to generate the snapshot without having to run the IG Publisher.

If you run SUSHI from the same directory where your .fsh files are located, and accept the defaults, the command can be shortened to:

```
$ sushi .
```

#### Error Messages

In the process of developing your IG using FSH, you may encounter SUSHI error messages (written to the command console). Most error messages point to a specific line or lines in a `.fsh` file. If possible, SUSHI will continue, despite errors, to produce FHIR artifacts, but those artifacts will omit any problematic rules. SUSHI should always exit gracefully. If SUSHI crashes, please report the issue using the [SUSHI issue tracker](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues).

Here are some general tips on approaching debugging:

* Eliminate parsing (syntax) errors first. Messages include `extraneous input {x} expecting {y}`, `mismatched input {x} expecting {y}` and `no viable alternative at {x}`. These messages indicate that the line in question is not a valid FSH statement.
* The order of keywords is not arbitrary. The declarations must start with the type of item you are creating (e.g., Profile, Instance, ValueSet).
* The order of rules usually doesn't matter, but there are exceptions. Slices and extensions must be created (with `contains` rule) before they are constrained.
* A common error is `No element found at path`. This means although the overall grammar of the statement is correct, SUSHI could not find the FHIR element you are referring to in the rule. Make sure there is no spelling error, the element names in the path are correct, and you are using the [path grammar](reference.html#paths) correctly.

### IG Creation

SUSHI supports publishing implementation guides via the new template-based IG Publisher. See the [Guidance for HL7 IG Creation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/) for more details.

#### SUSHI Inputs

SUSHI uses the contents of a user-created **ig-data** directory to generate the inputs to the IG Publisher. Currently, you must create and populate this directory manually. If the input directory does not contain a subdirectory named **ig-data**, then only the FHIR artifacts (e.g., profiles, extensions, etc.) will be generated.

A populated **ig-data** directory should look something like this:

```
/ig-data
├── ig.ini (optional)
├── package-list.json (optional)
└── /input
    ├── ignoreWarnings.txt (optional)
    ├── /images
    │   ├── myGraphic.jpg
    │   ├── myDocument.docx
    │   └── mySpreadsheet.xlsx
    ├── /includes
    │   └── menu.xml (optional)
    └── /pagecontent
        ├── index.md
        ├── 1_mySecondPage.md
        ├── 2_myThirdPage.md
        └── 3_myFourthPage.md
```

Populate these directories as follows:

* **ig.ini**: If present, the user-provided values will be merged with SUSHI-generated **ig.ini**.
* **package-list.json**: This file should contain the version history of your IG. If present, it will be used instead of a generated **package-list.json**.
* The **/images** subdirectory: Put anything that is not a page in the IG, such as images, spreadsheets or zip files, in the **images** subdirectory. These files will be copied into the build and can be referenced by user-provided pages or menus.
* **menu.xml**: If present, this file will be used for the IG's main menu layout.
* The **/pagecontent** subdirectory, put either markup (.xml) or markdown (.md) files with the narrative content of your IG:
  * **index.xml\|md**: This file provides the content for the IG's main page.
  * **N\_pagename.xml\|md**: If present, these files will be generated as individual pages in the IG. The leading integer (N) determines the order of the pages in the table of contents. These numbers are stripped and do not appear in the actual page URLs.
  * **{artifact-file-name}-intro.xml\|md**: If present, the contents of the file will be placed on the relevant page _before_ the artifact's definition.
  * **{artifact-file-name}-notes.xml\|md**: If present, the contents of the file will be placed on the relevant page _after_ the artifact's definition.

Examples of **ig.ini**, **package-list.json**, **ignoreWarnings.txt** and **menu.xml** files can be found in the [sample IG project](https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig) provided for this purpose. More general guidance can be found in [Guidance for HL7 IG Creation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/). The [mCODE Implementation Guide](https://github.com/standardhealth/fsh-mcode) has a good example of a populated **ig-data** directory.

#### SUSHI Outputs

Based on the inputs in FSH files and the **ig-data** directory, SUSHI populates the specified output directory (**build** by default). SUSHI will create the [ImplementationGuide resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/implementationguide.html) for your IG, which can be found in **/build/input** after you run SUSHI.

The resulting **/build** directory will look something like this:

```
/build
├── _genonce.bat
├── _genonce.sh
├── _gencontinuous.bat
├── _gencontinous.sh
├── _updatePublisher.sh
├── _updatePublisher.sh
├── ig.ini
├── package.json
├── package-list.json
└── /input
    ├── ImplementationGuide-myIG.json
    ├── ignoreWarnings.txt
    ├── /examples
    │   └── Patient-myPatient-example.json
    ├── /extensions
    │   └── StructureDefinition-myExtension.json
    ├── /images
    │   ├── myGraphic.jpg
    │   ├── myDocument.docx
    │   └── mySpreadsheet.xlsx
    ├── /includes
    │   └── menu.xml
    ├── /pagecontent
    │   ├── index.md
    │   ├── mySecondPage.md
    │   ├── myThirdPage.md
    │   └── myFourthPage.md
    ├── /profiles
    │   └── StructureDefinition-myProfile.json
    └── /vocabulary
        ├── ValueSet-myValueSet.json
        └── CodeSystem-myCodeSystem.json
```

 SUSHI puts each item where the FHIR publisher expects to find them, assuming the IG publisher is run from the **/build** directory. 
 
 > Note: The **/build/input** directory is actually an _output_ of SUSHI, but so named because it is an _input_ to the IG Publisher.

### Downloading and Running the IG Publisher

After running SUSHI, change directories to the output directory, usually **/build**. At the command prompt, enter:

```
💻$  _updatePublisher
```

```
🍎$  ./_updatePublisher.sh
```

This will download the latest version of the HL7 FHIR IG Publisher tool into the **/build/input-cache** directory. _This step can be skipped if you already have the latest version of the IG Publisher tool in **input-cache**._

> **Note:** If you are blocked by a firewall, or if for any reason `_updatePublisher` fails to execute, download the current IG Publisher jar file [here](https://fhir.github.io/latest-ig-publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.jar). When the file has downloaded, move it into the directory **/build/input-cache** (create the directory if necessary.)

Now run:

```
💻$  _genonce
```

```
🍎$  ./_genonce.sh
```

This will run the HL7 IG Publisher, which will take several minutes to complete. After the publisher is finished, open the file **/build/output/index.html** in a browser to see the resulting IG.
