SUSHI ("SUSHI Unshortens ShortHand Inputs") is a reference implementation of an interpreter/compiler for the FHIR Shorthand ("FSH" or "Shorthand") language. SUSHI produces [Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/overview.html) profiles, extensions, and other artifacts needed to create FHIR Implementation Guides (IG).

**As of August 2020, SUSHI documentation has moved [to the FSH School web site](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/).**
